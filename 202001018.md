- I have used Prospector tool to check Python code and output information about errors, problems,violations opf segmantation and complexity. It is combine of other Python analysis tools such as Pylint, pycodestyle.

- we can intialise some of the factors of error type such as

  - strictness: high
  
  - test-warnings: True
  
  - doc-warnings: false

- We can also ask prospector to ignore some of event using
  disable:
    - too-many-instance-attributes

### 1 : Unused Import 

Error pop-up when you don't use libraries which is imported

- In case if you want to ignore 

Use
pylint:
   disable:
    - unused-import
    
### 2: import-error / Unable to import 'torch

Error comes when we used library which is not standard library of python.

- How can we overcome this:

package = 'torch'
try:
    return __import__(package)
except ImportError:
    return None
    
    
### 3: pointless-string-statement / String statement has no effect

Used when a string is used as a statement (which of course has no effect).It is case of W0104.

- How we can ignore this 

disable:
  W0104
  

### 4: W605 / invalid escape sequence '\D' (col 43)

Problem arise when invalid escape sequence found, so we can use row form or escape the backslashes.

### 5: unspecified-encoding / Using open without explicitly specifying an encoding (col 9)

Using open without  specifying an encoding. we can specify encode while importing file

- example with problem

### 6: django-not-available / Django is not available on the PYTHONPATH

It may arise when something wrong with installing Django in the local environment.
We may add path to environment to overcome error in local.
